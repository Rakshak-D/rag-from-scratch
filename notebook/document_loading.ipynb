Introduction\\nDeep convolutional neural networks [22, 21] have led\\nto a series of breakthroughs for image classiﬁcation [21,\\n50, 40]. Deep networks naturally integrate low/mid/high-\\nlevel features [50] and classiﬁers in an end-to-end multi-\\nlayer fashion, and the “levels” of features can be enriched\\nby the number of stacked layers (depth). Recent evidence\\n[41, 44] reveals that network depth is of crucial importance,\\nand the leading results [41, 44, 13, 16] on the challenging\\nImageNet dataset [36] all exploit “very deep” [41] models,\\nwith a depth of sixteen [41] to thirty [16]. Many other non-\\ntrivial visual recognition tasks [8, 12, 7, 32, 27] have also\\n1http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/\\nand\\nhttp://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015.\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n0 \\n10\\n20\\niter.

Fig. 1 shows a typical example.\\nThe degradation (of training accuracy) indicates that not\\nall systems are similarly easy to optimize. Let us consider a\\nshallower architecture and its deeper counterpart that adds\\nmore layers onto it. There exists a solution by construction\\nto the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping,\\nand the other layers are copied from the learned shallower\\nmodel. The existence of this constructed solution indicates\\nthat a deeper model should produce no higher training error\\nthan its shallower counterpart. But experiments show that\\nour current solvers on hand are unable to ﬁnd solutions that\\n1\\narXiv:1512.03385v1  [cs.CV]  10 Dec 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2015-12-11T01:13:45+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\He et al. - 2015 - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\He et al. - 2015 - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2015-12-11T01:13:45+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20151211011345Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20151211011345Z', 'page': 1}, page_content='identity\\nweight layer\\nweight layer\\nrelu\\nrelu\\nF(x)\\x01+\\x01x\\nx\\nF(x)\\nx\\nFigure 2.

Formally, denoting the desired\\nunderlying mapping as H(x), we let the stacked nonlinear\\nlayers ﬁt another mapping of F(x) := H(x)−x. The orig-\\ninal mapping is recast into F(x)+x. We hypothesize that it\\nis easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize\\nthe original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an\\nidentity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push\\nthe residual to zero than to ﬁt an identity mapping by a stack\\nof nonlinear layers.\\nThe formulation of F(x)+x can be realized by feedfor-\\nward neural networks with “shortcut connections” (Fig. 2).\\nShortcut connections [2, 34, 49] are those skipping one or\\nmore layers. In our case, the shortcut connections simply\\nperform identity mapping, and their outputs are added to\\nthe outputs of the stacked layers (Fig. 2). Identity short-\\ncut connections add neither extra parameter nor computa-\\ntional complexity. The entire network can still be trained\\nend-to-end by SGD with backpropagation, and can be eas-\\nily implemented using common libraries (e.g., Caffe [19])\\nwithout modifying the solvers.\\nWe present comprehensive experiments on ImageNet\\n[36] to show the degradation problem and evaluate our\\nmethod. We show that: 1) Our extremely deep residual nets\\nare easy to optimize, but the counterpart “plain” nets (that\\nsimply stack layers) exhibit higher training error when the\\ndepth increases; 2) Our deep residual nets can easily enjoy\\naccuracy gains from greatly increased depth, producing re-\\nsults substantially better than previous networks.\\nSimilar phenomena are also shown on the CIFAR-10 set\\n[20], suggesting that the optimization difﬁculties and the\\neffects of our method are not just akin to a particular dataset.\\nWe present successfully trained models on this dataset with\\nover 100 layers, and explore models with over 1000 layers.\\nOn the ImageNet classiﬁcation dataset [36], we obtain\\nexcellent results by extremely deep residual nets. Our 152-\\nlayer residual net is the deepest network ever presented on\\nImageNet, while still having lower complexity than VGG\\nnets [41].\\nOur ensemble has 3.57% top-5 error on the\\nImageNet test set, and won the 1st place in the ILSVRC\\n2015 classiﬁcation competition. The extremely deep rep-\\nresentations also have excellent generalization performance\\non other recognition tasks, and lead us to further win the\\n1st places on: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization,\\nCOCO detection, and COCO segmentation in ILSVRC &\\nCOCO 2015 competitions. This strong evidence shows that\\nthe residual learning principle is generic, and we expect that\\nit is applicable in other vision and non-vision problems.\\n2. Related Work\\nResidual Representations. In image recognition, VLAD\\n[18] is a representation that encodes by the residual vectors\\nwith respect to a dictionary, and Fisher Vector [30] can be\\nformulated as a probabilistic version [18] of VLAD. Both\\nof them are powerful shallow representations for image re-\\ntrieval and classiﬁcation [4, 48]. For vector quantization,\\nencoding residual vectors [17] is shown to be more effec-\\ntive than encoding original vectors.\\nIn low-level vision and computer graphics, for solv-\\ning Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), the widely used\\nMultigrid method [3] reformulates the system as subprob-\\nlems at multiple scales, where each subproblem is respon-\\nsible for the residual solution between a coarser and a ﬁner\\nscale. An alternative to Multigrid is hierarchical basis pre-\\nconditioning [45, 46], which relies on variables that repre-\\nsent residual vectors between two scales. It has been shown\\n[3, 45, 46] that these solvers converge much faster than stan-\\ndard solvers that are unaware of the residual nature of the\\nsolutions. These methods suggest that a good reformulation\\nor preconditioning can simplify the optimization.\\nShortcut Connections. Practices and theories that lead to\\nshortcut connections [2, 34, 49] have been studied for a long\\ntime. An early practice of training multi-layer perceptrons\\n(MLPs) is to add a linear layer connected from the network\\ninput to the output [34, 49]. In [44, 24], a few interme-\\ndiate layers are directly connected to auxiliary classiﬁers\\nfor addressing vanishing/exploding gradients. The papers\\nof [39, 38, 31, 47] propose methods for centering layer re-\\nsponses, gradients, and propagated errors, implemented by\\nshortcut connections. In [44], an “inception” layer is com-\\nposed of a shortcut branch and a few deeper branches.\\nConcurrent with our work, “highway networks” [42, 43]\\npresent shortcut connections with gating functions [15].\\nThese gates are data-dependent and have parameters, in\\ncontrast to our identity shortcuts that are parameter-free.\\nWhen a gated shortcut is “closed” (approaching zero), the\\nlayers in highway networks represent non-residual func-\\ntions.\\nOn the contrary, our formulation always learns\\nresidual functions; our identity shortcuts are never closed,\\nand all information is always passed through, with addi-\\ntional residual functions to be learned.

Deep Residual Learning\\n3.1. Residual Learning\\nLet us consider H(x) as an underlying mapping to be\\nﬁt by a few stacked layers (not necessarily the entire net),\\nwith x denoting the inputs to the ﬁrst of these layers. If one\\nhypothesizes that multiple nonlinear layers can asymptoti-\\ncally approximate complicated functions2, then it is equiv-\\nalent to hypothesize that they can asymptotically approxi-\\nmate the residual functions, i.e., H(x) −x (assuming that\\nthe input and output are of the same dimensions).\\nSo\\nrather than expect stacked layers to approximate H(x), we\\nexplicitly let these layers approximate a residual function\\nF(x) := H(x) −x. The original function thus becomes\\nF(x)+x. Although both forms should be able to asymptot-\\nically approximate the desired functions (as hypothesized),\\nthe ease of learning might be different.\\nThis reformulation is motivated by the counterintuitive\\nphenomena about the degradation problem (Fig. 1, left). As\\nwe discussed in the introduction, if the added layers can\\nbe constructed as identity mappings, a deeper model should\\nhave training error no greater than its shallower counter-\\npart.\\nThe degradation problem suggests that the solvers\\nmight have difﬁculties in approximating identity mappings\\nby multiple nonlinear layers. With the residual learning re-\\nformulation, if identity mappings are optimal, the solvers\\nmay simply drive the weights of the multiple nonlinear lay-\\ners toward zero to approach identity mappings.\\nIn real cases, it is unlikely that identity mappings are op-\\ntimal, but our reformulation may help to precondition the\\nproblem. If the optimal function is closer to an identity\\nmapping than to a zero mapping, it should be easier for the\\nsolver to ﬁnd the perturbations with reference to an identity\\nmapping, than to learn the function as a new one. We show\\nby experiments (Fig. 7) that the learned residual functions in\\ngeneral have small responses, suggesting that identity map-\\npings provide reasonable preconditioning.\\n3.2. Identity Mapping by Shortcuts\\nWe adopt residual learning to every few stacked layers.\\nA building block is shown in Fig. 2. Formally, in this paper\\nwe consider a building block deﬁned as:\\ny = F(x, {Wi}) + x.\\n(1)\\nHere x and y are the input and output vectors of the lay-\\ners considered.\\nThe function F(x, {Wi}) represents the\\nresidual mapping to be learned. For the example in Fig. 2\\nthat has two layers, F = W2σ(W1x) in which σ denotes\\n2This hypothesis, however, is still an open question. See [28].\\nReLU [29] and the biases are omitted for simplifying no-\\ntations. The operation F + x is performed by a shortcut\\nconnection and element-wise addition. We adopt the sec-\\nond nonlinearity after the addition (i.e., σ(y), see Fig. 2).\\nThe shortcut connections in Eqn.(1) introduce neither ex-\\ntra parameter nor computation complexity. This is not only\\nattractive in practice but also important in our comparisons\\nbetween plain and residual networks. We can fairly com-\\npare plain/residual networks that simultaneously have the\\nsame number of parameters, depth, width, and computa-\\ntional cost (except for the negligible element-wise addition).\\nThe dimensions of x and F must be equal in Eqn.(1).\\nIf this is not the case (e.g., when changing the input/output\\nchannels), we can perform a linear projection Ws by the\\nshortcut connections to match the dimensions:\\ny = F(x, {Wi}) + Wsx.\\n(2)\\nWe can also use a square matrix Ws in Eqn.(1). But we will\\nshow by experiments that the identity mapping is sufﬁcient\\nfor addressing the degradation problem and is economical,\\nand thus Ws is only used when matching dimensions.\\nThe form of the residual function F is ﬂexible. Exper-\\niments in this paper involve a function F that has two or\\nthree layers (Fig. 5), while more layers are possible. But if\\nF has only a single layer, Eqn.(1) is similar to a linear layer:\\ny = W1x + x, for which we have not observed advantages.\\nWe also note that although the above notations are about\\nfully-connected layers for simplicity, they are applicable to\\nconvolutional layers. The function F(x, {Wi}) can repre-\\nsent multiple convolutional layers. The element-wise addi-\\ntion is performed on two feature maps, channel by channel.\\n3.3. Network Architectures\\nWe have tested various plain/residual nets, and have ob-\\nserved consistent phenomena. To provide instances for dis-\\ncussion, we describe two models for ImageNet as follows.\\nPlain Network. Our plain baselines (Fig. 3, middle) are\\nmainly inspired by the philosophy of VGG nets [41] (Fig. 3,\\nleft). The convolutional layers mostly have 3×3 ﬁlters and\\nfollow two simple design rules: (i) for the same output\\nfeature map size, the layers have the same number of ﬁl-\\nters; and (ii) if the feature map size is halved, the num-\\nber of ﬁlters is doubled so as to preserve the time com-\\nplexity per layer.

Table 1 shows\\nmore details and other variants.\\nResidual Network. Based on the above plain network, we\\ninsert shortcut connections (Fig. 3, right) which turn the\\nnetwork into its counterpart residual version. The identity\\nshortcuts (Eqn.(1)) can be directly used when the input and\\noutput are of the same dimensions (solid line shortcuts in\\nFig. 3). When the dimensions increase (dotted line shortcuts\\nin Fig. 3), we consider two options: (A) The shortcut still\\nperforms identity mapping, with extra zero entries padded\\nfor increasing dimensions. This option introduces no extra\\nparameter; (B) The projection shortcut in Eqn.(2) is used to\\nmatch dimensions (done by 1×1 convolutions). For both\\noptions, when the shortcuts go across feature maps of two\\nsizes, they are performed with a stride of 2.\\n3.4. Implementation\\nOur implementation for ImageNet follows the practice\\nin [21, 41]. The image is resized with its shorter side ran-\\ndomly sampled in [256, 480] for scale augmentation [41].\\nA 224×224 crop is randomly sampled from an image or its\\nhorizontal ﬂip, with the per-pixel mean subtracted [21]. The\\nstandard color augmentation in [21] is used. We adopt batch\\nnormalization (BN) [16] right after each convolution and\\nbefore activation, following [16]. We initialize the weights\\nas in [13] and train all plain/residual nets from scratch. We\\nuse SGD with a mini-batch size of 256. The learning rate\\nstarts from 0.1 and is divided by 10 when the error plateaus,\\nand the models are trained for up to 60 × 104 iterations. We\\nuse a weight decay of 0.0001 and a momentum of 0.9. We\\ndo not use dropout [14], following the practice in [16].\\nIn testing, for comparison studies we adopt the standard\\n10-crop testing [21]. For best results, we adopt the fully-\\nconvolutional form as in [41, 13], and average the scores\\nat multiple scales (images are resized such that the shorter\\nside is in {224, 256, 384, 480, 640}).\\n4. Experiments\\n4.1. ImageNet Classiﬁcation\\nWe evaluate our method on the ImageNet 2012 classiﬁ-\\ncation dataset [36] that consists of 1000 classes. The models\\nare trained on the 1.28 million training images, and evalu-\\nated on the 50k validation images.

Fig. 4 shows the training procedures.\\n34-layer plain net has higher training error throughout the\\nwhole training procedure, even though the solution space\\nof the 18-layer plain network is a subspace of that of the\\n34-layer one.\\nWe argue that this optimization difﬁculty is unlikely to\\nbe caused by vanishing gradients. These plain networks are\\ntrained with BN [16], which ensures forward propagated\\nsignals to have non-zero variances. We also verify that the\\nbackward propagated gradients exhibit healthy norms with\\nBN. So neither forward nor backward signals vanish. In\\nfact, the 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve compet-\\nitive accuracy (Table 3), suggesting that the solver works\\nto some extent. We conjecture that the deep plain nets may\\nhave exponentially low convergence rates, which impact the\\nreducing of the training error3. The reason for such opti-\\nmization difﬁculties will be studied in the future.\\nResidual Networks. Next we evaluate 18-layer and 34-\\nlayer residual nets (ResNets). The baseline architectures\\nare the same as the above plain nets, expect that a shortcut\\nconnection is added to each pair of 3×3 ﬁlters as in Fig. 3\\n(right). In the ﬁrst comparison (Table 2 and Fig. 4 right),\\nwe use identity mapping for all shortcuts and zero-padding\\nfor increasing dimensions (option A). So they have no extra\\nparameter compared to the plain counterparts.\\nWe have three major observations from Table 2 and\\nFig. 4. First, the situation is reversed with residual learn-\\ning – the 34-layer ResNet is better than the 18-layer ResNet\\n(by 2.8%). More importantly, the 34-layer ResNet exhibits\\nconsiderably lower training error and is generalizable to the\\nvalidation data. This indicates that the degradation problem\\nis well addressed in this setting and we manage to obtain\\naccuracy gains from increased depth.\\nSecond, compared to its plain counterpart, the 34-layer\\n3We have experimented with more training iterations (3×) and still ob-\\nserved the degradation problem, suggesting that this problem cannot be\\nfeasibly addressed by simply using more iterations.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2015-12-11T01:13:45+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\He et al. - 2015 - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\He et al. - 2015 - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2015-12-11T01:13:45+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20151211011345Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20151211011345Z', 'page': 5}, page_content='model\\ntop-1 err.\\ntop-5 err.\\nVGG-16 [41]\\n28.07\\n9.33\\nGoogLeNet [44]\\n-\\n9.15\\nPReLU-net [13]\\n24.27\\n7.38\\nplain-34\\n28.54\\n10.02\\nResNet-34 A\\n25.03\\n7.76\\nResNet-34 B\\n24.52\\n7.46\\nResNet-34 C\\n24.19\\n7.40\\nResNet-50\\n22.85\\n6.71\\nResNet-101\\n21.75\\n6.05\\nResNet-152\\n21.43\\n5.71\\nTable 3.

Next\\nwe investigate projection shortcuts (Eqn.(2)). In Table 3 we\\ncompare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used\\nfor increasing dimensions, and all shortcuts are parameter-\\nfree (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projec-\\ntion shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other\\nshortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections.\\nTable 3 shows that all three options are considerably bet-\\nter than the plain counterpart. B is slightly better than A. We\\nargue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A\\nindeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than\\nB, and we attribute this to the extra parameters introduced\\nby many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small dif-\\nferences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are\\nnot essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we\\ndo not use option C in the rest of this paper, to reduce mem-\\nory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are\\nparticularly important for not increasing the complexity of\\nthe bottleneck architectures that are introduced below.\\nDeeper Bottleneck Architectures. Next we describe our\\ndeeper nets for ImageNet. Because of concerns on the train-\\ning time that we can afford, we modify the building block\\nas a bottleneck design4. For each residual function F, we\\nuse a stack of 3 layers instead of 2 (Fig. 5). The three layers\\nare 1×1, 3×3, and 1×1 convolutions, where the 1×1 layers\\nare responsible for reducing and then increasing (restoring)\\ndimensions, leaving the 3×3 layer a bottleneck with smaller\\ninput/output dimensions. Fig. 5 shows an example, where\\nboth designs have similar time complexity.\\nThe parameter-free identity shortcuts are particularly im-\\nportant for the bottleneck architectures. If the identity short-\\ncut in Fig. 5 (right) is replaced with projection, one can\\nshow that the time complexity and model size are doubled,\\nas the shortcut is connected to the two high-dimensional\\nends. So identity shortcuts lead to more efﬁcient models\\nfor the bottleneck designs.\\n50-layer ResNet: We replace each 2-layer block in the\\n4Deeper non-bottleneck ResNets (e.g., Fig. 5 left) also gain accuracy\\nfrom increased depth (as shown on CIFAR-10), but are not as economical\\nas the bottleneck ResNets. So the usage of bottleneck designs is mainly due\\nto practical considerations. We further note that the degradation problem\\nof plain nets is also witnessed for the bottleneck designs.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.12', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2015-12-11T01:13:45+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\He et al. - 2015 - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\He et al. - 2015 - Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2015-12-11T01:13:45+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20151211011345Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20151211011345Z', 'page': 6}, page_content='34-layer net with this 3-layer bottleneck block, resulting in\\na 50-layer ResNet (Table 1).

These models are trained with a mini-\\nbatch size of 128 on two GPUs.

Object Detection Baselines\\nIn this section we introduce our detection method based\\non the baseline Faster R-CNN [32] system. The models are\\ninitialized by the ImageNet classiﬁcation models, and then\\nﬁne-tuned on the object detection data. We have experi-\\nmented with ResNet-50/101 at the time of the ILSVRC &\\nCOCO 2015 detection competitions.\\nUnlike VGG-16 used in [32], our ResNet has no hidden\\nfc layers. We adopt the idea of “Networks on Conv fea-\\nture maps” (NoC) [33] to address this issue. We compute\\nthe full-image shared conv feature maps using those lay-\\ners whose strides on the image are no greater than 16 pixels\\n(i.e., conv1, conv2 x, conv3 x, and conv4 x, totally 91 conv\\nlayers in ResNet-101; Table 1). We consider these layers as\\nanalogous to the 13 conv layers in VGG-16, and by doing\\nso, both ResNet and VGG-16 have conv feature maps of the\\nsame total stride (16 pixels). These layers are shared by a\\nregion proposal network (RPN, generating 300 proposals)\\n[32] and a Fast R-CNN detection network [7]. RoI pool-\\ning [7] is performed before conv5 1. On this RoI-pooled\\nfeature, all layers of conv5 x and up are adopted for each\\nregion, playing the roles of VGG-16’s fc layers. The ﬁnal\\nclassiﬁcation layer is replaced by two sibling layers (classi-\\nﬁcation and box regression [7]).\\nFor the usage of BN layers, after pre-training, we com-\\npute the BN statistics (means and variances) for each layer\\non the ImageNet training set. Then the BN layers are ﬁxed\\nduring ﬁne-tuning for object detection. As such, the BN\\nlayers become linear activations with constant offsets and\\nscales, and BN statistics are not updated by ﬁne-tuning. We\\nﬁx the BN layers mainly for reducing memory consumption\\nin Faster R-CNN training.\\nPASCAL VOC\\nFollowing [7, 32], for the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set,\\nwe use the 5k trainval images in VOC 2007 and 16k train-\\nval images in VOC 2012 for training (“07+12”). For the\\nPASCAL VOC 2012 test set, we use the 10k trainval+test\\nimages in VOC 2007 and 16k trainval images in VOC 2012\\nfor training (“07++12”). The hyper-parameters for train-\\ning Faster R-CNN are the same as in [32]. Table 7 shows\\nthe results. ResNet-101 improves the mAP by >3% over\\nVGG-16. This gain is solely because of the improved fea-\\ntures learned by ResNet.\\nMS COCO\\nThe MS COCO dataset [26] involves 80 object cate-\\ngories. We evaluate the PASCAL VOC metric (mAP @\\nIoU = 0.5) and the standard COCO metric (mAP @ IoU =\\n.5:.05:.95). We use the 80k images on the train set for train-\\ning and the 40k images on the val set for evaluation. Our\\ndetection system for COCO is similar to that for PASCAL\\nVOC. We train the COCO models with an 8-GPU imple-\\nmentation, and thus the RPN step has a mini-batch size of\\n8 images (i.e., 1 per GPU) and the Fast R-CNN step has a\\nmini-batch size of 16 images. The RPN step and Fast R-\\nCNN step are both trained for 240k iterations with a learn-\\ning rate of 0.001 and then for 80k iterations with 0.0001.\\nTable 8 shows the results on the MS COCO validation\\nset. ResNet-101 has a 6% increase of mAP@[.5, .95] over\\nVGG-16, which is a 28% relative improvement, solely con-\\ntributed by the features learned by the better network. Re-\\nmarkably, the mAP@[.5, .95]’s absolute increase (6.0%) is\\nnearly as big as mAP@.5’s (6.9%). This suggests that a\\ndeeper network can improve both recognition and localiza-\\ntion.\\nB. Object Detection Improvements\\nFor completeness, we report the improvements made for\\nthe competitions. These improvements are based on deep\\nfeatures and thus should beneﬁt from residual learning.\\nMS COCO\\nBox reﬁnement. Our box reﬁnement partially follows the it-\\nerative localization in [6]. In Faster R-CNN, the ﬁnal output\\nis a regressed box that is different from its proposal box. So\\nfor inference, we pool a new feature from the regressed box\\nand obtain a new classiﬁcation score and a new regressed\\nbox. We combine these 300 new predictions with the orig-\\ninal 300 predictions. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is\\napplied on the union set of predicted boxes using an IoU\\nthreshold of 0.3 [8], followed by box voting [6]. Box re-\\nﬁnement improves mAP by about 2 points (Table 9).\\nGlobal context.\\nWe combine global context in the Fast\\nR-CNN step. Given the full-image conv feature map, we\\npool a feature by global Spatial Pyramid Pooling [12] (with\\na “single-level” pyramid) which can be implemented as\\n“RoI” pooling using the entire image’s bounding box as the\\nRoI. This pooled feature is fed into the post-RoI layers to\\nobtain a global context feature. This global feature is con-\\ncatenated with the original per-region feature, followed by\\nthe sibling classiﬁcation and box regression layers. This\\nnew structure is trained end-to-end.\\nGlobal context im-\\nproves mAP@.5 by about 1 point (Table 9).\\nMulti-scale testing. In the above, all results are obtained by\\nsingle-scale training/testing as in [32], where the image’s\\nshorter side is s = 600 pixels. Multi-scale training/testing\\nhas been developed in [12, 7] by selecting a scale from a\\nfeature pyramid, and in [33] by using maxout layers. In\\nour current implementation, we have performed multi-scale\\ntesting following [33]; we have not performed multi-scale\\ntraining because of limited time.

ImageNet Localization\\nThe ImageNet Localization (LOC) task [36] requires to\\nclassify and localize the objects. Following [40, 41], we\\nassume that the image-level classiﬁers are ﬁrst adopted for\\npredicting the class labels of an image, and the localiza-\\ntion algorithm only accounts for predicting bounding boxes\\nbased on the predicted classes. We adopt the “per-class re-\\ngression” (PCR) strategy [40, 41], learning a bounding box\\nregressor for each class. We pre-train the networks for Im-\\nageNet classiﬁcation and then ﬁne-tune them for localiza-\\ntion. We train networks on the provided 1000-class Ima-\\ngeNet training set.\\nOur localization algorithm is based on the RPN frame-\\nwork of [32] with a few modiﬁcations. Unlike the way in\\n[32] that is category-agnostic, our RPN for localization is\\ndesigned in a per-class form. This RPN ends with two sib-\\nling 1×1 convolutional layers for binary classiﬁcation (cls)\\nand box regression (reg), as in [32]. The cls and reg layers\\nare both in a per-class from, in contrast to [32]. Speciﬁ-\\ncally, the cls layer has a 1000-d output, and each dimension\\nis binary logistic regression for predicting being or not be-\\ning an object class; the reg layer has a 1000×4-d output\\nconsisting of box regressors for 1000 classes. As in [32],\\nour bounding box regression is with reference to multiple\\ntranslation-invariant “anchor” boxes at each position.\\nAs in our ImageNet classiﬁcation training (Sec. 3.4), we\\nrandomly sample 224×224 crops for data augmentation.\\nWe use a mini-batch size of 256 images for ﬁne-tuning. To\\navoid negative samples being dominate, 8 anchors are ran-\\ndomly sampled for each image, where the sampled positive\\nand negative anchors have a ratio of 1:1 [32]. For testing,\\nthe network is applied on the image fully-convolutionally.\\nTable 13 compares the localization results. Following\\n[41], we ﬁrst perform “oracle” testing using the ground truth\\nclass as the classiﬁcation prediction.

Under the same setting, our RPN method us-\\ning ResNet-101 net signiﬁcantly reduces the center-crop er-\\nror to 13.3%. This comparison demonstrates the excellent\\nperformance of our framework. With dense (fully convolu-\\ntional) and multi-scale testing, our ResNet-101 has an error\\nof 11.7% using ground truth classes. Using ResNet-101 for\\npredicting classes (4.6% top-5 classiﬁcation error, Table 4),\\nthe top-5 localization error is 14.4%.\\nThe above results are only based on the proposal network\\n(RPN) in Faster R-CNN [32]. One may use the detection\\nnetwork (Fast R-CNN [7]) in Faster R-CNN to improve the\\nresults. But we notice that on this dataset, one image usually\\ncontains a single dominate object, and the proposal regions\\nhighly overlap with each other and thus have very similar\\nRoI-pooled features. As a result, the image-centric training\\nof Fast R-CNN [7] generates samples of small variations,\\nwhich may not be desired for stochastic training. Motivated\\nby this, in our current experiment we use the original R-\\nCNN [8] that is RoI-centric, in place of Fast R-CNN.\\nOur R-CNN implementation is as follows. We apply the\\nper-class RPN trained as above on the training images to\\npredict bounding boxes for the ground truth class. These\\npredicted boxes play a role of class-dependent proposals.\\nFor each training image, the highest scored 200 proposals\\nare extracted as training samples to train an R-CNN classi-\\nﬁer. The image region is cropped from a proposal, warped\\nto 224×224 pixels, and fed into the classiﬁcation network\\nas in R-CNN [8]. The outputs of this network consist of two\\nsibling fc layers for cls and reg, also in a per-class form.\\nThis R-CNN network is ﬁne-tuned on the training set us-\\ning a mini-batch size of 256 in the RoI-centric fashion. For\\ntesting, the RPN generates the highest scored 200 proposals\\nfor each predicted class, and the R-CNN network is used to\\nupdate these proposals’ scores and box positions.\\nThis method reduces the top-5 localization error to\\n10.6% (Table 13). This is our single-model result on the\\nvalidation set. Using an ensemble of networks for both clas-\\nsiﬁcation and localization, we achieve a top-5 localization\\nerror of 9.0% on the test set. This number signiﬁcantly out-\\nperforms the ILSVRC 14 results (Table 14), showing a 64%\\nrelative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in\\nthe ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.\\n12'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 0}, page_content='Retrieval-Augmented Generation for\\nKnowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\\nPatrick Lewis†‡, Ethan Perez⋆,\\nAleksandra Piktus†, Fabio Petroni†, Vladimir Karpukhin†, Naman Goyal†, Heinrich Küttler†,\\nMike Lewis†, Wen-tau Yih†, Tim Rocktäschel†‡, Sebastian Riedel†‡, Douwe Kiela†\\n†Facebook AI Research; ‡University College London; ⋆New York University;\\nplewis@fb.com\\nAbstract\\nLarge pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge\\nin their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when ﬁne-tuned on down-\\nstream NLP tasks.

We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token.

They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted.

We combine a pre-trained retriever (Query Encoder + Document\\nIndex) with a pre-trained seq2seq model (Generator) and ﬁne-tune end-to-end. For query x, we use\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we\\ntreat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stack-\\naugmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2\\nMethods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x) with parameters η that returns (top-K truncated)\\ndistributions over text passages given a query x and (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1) parametrized\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners Library [66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\\nexamples/rag/.

In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1\\nModels\\nRAG-Sequence Model\\nThe RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(y|x, z) =\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)\\nN\\nY\\ni\\npθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model\\nIn the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ≈\\nN\\nY\\ni\\nX\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2\\nRetriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x) ∝exp\\n\\x00d(z)⊤q(x)\\n\\x01\\nd(z) = BERTd(z), q(x) = BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\\ntop-k(pη(·|x)), the list of k documents z with highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index.

We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n2.3\\nGenerator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nx with the retrieved content z when generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters θ as the parametric memory henceforth.\\n2.4\\nTraining\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what\\ndocument should be retrieved.

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x, z, y1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY , some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y | can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x, zi) ≈0 where y was not generated during beam\\nsearch from x, zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3\\nExperiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nk documents for each query. We consider k ∈{5, 10} for training and set k for test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1\\nOpen-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x, y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2\\nAbstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n4'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 4}, page_content='MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n“What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4\\nFact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4\\nResults\\n4.1\\nOpen-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-\\nments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards\\na correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 5}, page_content='Table 1: Open-Domain QA Test Scores.

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers\\neven when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such\\ncases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%.\\n4.2\\nAbstractive Question Answering\\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu\\npoints and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding \"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A\\nwith \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4\\nFact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 6}, page_content='Document 1: his works are considered classics of American\\nliterature ...

We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5\\nAdditional Results\\nGeneration Diversity\\nSection 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations\\nA key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping\\nAn advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018).

A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval\\nThere is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [44, 26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures\\nOur document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches\\nOur method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6\\nDiscussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 9}, page_content='Broader Impact\\nThis work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that it is more\\nstrongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it “hallucinate” less\\nwith generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\\nemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it\\nwith a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\\neffective at their jobs.\\nWith these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge\\nsource, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\\nemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [50] are valid here, although arguably\\nto a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content in\\nthe news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of spam/phishing\\ncontent [54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\\ncoming decades [16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\\nmisleading content and automated spam/phishing.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback on this\\npaper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG models.

A pop-out for detailed instructions\\nand a worked example appear when clicking \"view tool guide\".\\nFigure 4 shows the user interface for human evaluation. To avoid any biases for screen position,\\nwhich model corresponded to sentence A and sentence B was randomly selected for each example.\\nAnnotators were encouraged to research the topic using the internet, and were given detailed instruc-\\ntions and worked examples in a full instructions tab. We included some gold sentences in order to\\nassess the accuracy of the annotators. Two annotators did not perform well on these examples and\\ntheir annotations were removed from the results.\\nC\\nTraining setup Details\\nWe train all RAG models and BART baselines using Fairseq [45].2 We train with mixed precision\\nﬂoating point arithmetic [40], distributing training across 8, 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, though\\ntraining and inference can be run on one GPU. We ﬁnd that doing Maximum Inner Product Search\\nwith FAISS is sufﬁciently fast on CPU, so we store document index vectors on CPU, requiring ∼100\\nGB of CPU memory for all of Wikipedia. After submission, We have ported our code to HuggingFace\\nTransformers [66]3, which achieves equivalent performance to the previous version but is a cleaner\\nand easier to use implementation. This version is also open-sourced. We also compress the document\\nindex using FAISS’s compression tools, reducing the CPU memory requirement to 36GB. Scripts to\\nrun experiments with RAG can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/\\nblob/master/examples/rag/README.md and an interactive demo of a RAG model can be found\\nat https://huggingface.co/rag/\\n2https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq\\n3https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\\n17'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 17}, page_content='D\\nFurther Details on Open-Domain QA\\nFor open-domain QA, multiple answer annotations are often available for a given question. These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q, a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing\\nThe answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups\\nThe open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al. [52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE\\nFurther Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF\\nNull Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if k documents\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k + 1 predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG\\nParameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Lewis et al. - 2021 - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20210413004838Z', 'page': 18}, page_content='Table 7: Number of instances in the datasets used. *A hidden subset of this data is used for evaluation\\nTask\\nTrain\\nDevelopment\\nTest\\nNatural Questions\\n79169\\n8758\\n3611\\nTriviaQA\\n78786\\n8838\\n11314\\nWebQuestions\\n3418\\n362\\n2033\\nCuratedTrec\\n635\\n134\\n635\\nJeopardy Question Generation\\n97392\\n13714\\n26849\\nMS-MARCO\\n153726\\n12468\\n101093*\\nFEVER-3-way\\n145450\\n10000\\n10000\\nFEVER-2-way\\n96966\\n6666\\n6666\\nparameters.

In these cases, once retrieval had collapsed, the generator would learn to ignore the documents,\\nand the RAG model would perform equivalently to BART. The collapse could be due to a less-explicit\\nrequirement for factual knowledge in some tasks, or the longer target sequences, which could result\\nin less informative gradients for the retriever. Perez et al. [46] also found spurious retrieval results\\nwhen optimizing a retrieval component in order to improve performance on downstream tasks.\\nI\\nNumber of instances per dataset\\nThe number of training, development and test datapoints in each of our datasets is shown in Table 7.\\n19')]\n"

We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5%, MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7%, SQuAD v1.1 Test F1 to 93.2, and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1.

1. Introduction

Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks. These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference and paraphrasing, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering.

There are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo, uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as GPT, introduces minimal task-specific parameters and is trained on downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pre-trained parameters.

The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.
